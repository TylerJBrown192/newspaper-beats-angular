# Newspaper Beats Application
This is an app that allows the manager of a newspaper to add topics of news to the webpage. It then allows that manager to assign a reporter, who has a linked birthday and number of years they've worked for the newspaper, to that topic of news he wants them to cover.

## Instructions for use
The app is incredibly simplistic to use. Just click the initial link on the /home page and get started. Every step of the way has forms with placeholder text or examples to show you what to input. To see more information on some topics, like reporters, just click where it says "click there"!
